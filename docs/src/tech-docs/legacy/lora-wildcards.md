title: LoRa Wildcards
---

When making a search operation with wildcards, a lot happens. Going from the
_bottom_ of the stack the following happens:

In SQL the match between two strings is made with [ILIKE from
PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11.7/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-LIKE).
It is a case-insensitive string match that supports the wildcard
operators `_` (underscore) to match a single character and `%` (percent
sign) to match zero or more characters. To match a litteral underscore
or percentage sign you must escape it with a single backslash as `\_` or
`\%`

In `/oio_rest/oio_rest/utils/build_registration.py` all incomming underscores `_` are
replaced by an escaped underscore `\_`. This means it is not possible for the REST API
user to send an underscore wildcard operator to SQL. This may change in the future.

FastAPI et. al. take care of decoding
[RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986.html#section-2)
percentage-encoded URIs. This means a percentage sign followed by two
case insensitive hexidecimal signs (`0-F`) is decoded into the
corresponding ASCII symbol. E.g. a `%45` in an URI is decoded to `E` in
SQL and `%25` is decoded to `%`. However a percentage sign followed by
something where the first character is anything other than a hexidecimal
sign is ignored. E.g. `%g4` in an URI also remains `%g4` in SQL and
`%magenta` remains `%magenta`.

These three mechanisms combined results in some very novel behavior. See
the table below:

| URI Query       | PGSQL     | RegEx       | Matches                                           |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `jkl`           | `jkl`     | `^jkl$`     | the string `jkl`                                  |
| `_jkl`          | `\_jkl`   | `%jkl`      | a litteral underscore followed by `jkl`           |
| `%jkl`/`%25jkl` | `%jkl`    | `^.*jkl$`   | zero or more of any characters followed by `jkl`  |
| `%abc`          | `�c`      | `^�c$`      | the character 0xAB followed by `c`                |
| `%afdeling`     | `�deling` | `^�deling$` | the character 0xAF followed by `deling`           |
| `E6`/`%456`     | `E6`      | `^E6$`      | the string `E6`                                   |
| `%25456`        | `%456`    | `^.*456$`   | zero or more of any characters followed by `456`  |
| `\_jkl`         | `\\_jkl`  | `\\_jkl$`   | a `\` followed by any character followed by `jkl` |

The best way to avoid most of the confusion is to always
percentage-encode your URI and never write `\_` in your query.

!!! attention
**Always** use `RFC 3986 <3986#section-2>`{.interpreted-text role="rfc"}
percentage-encoding for your search URI!
