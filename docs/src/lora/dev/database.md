title: Database structure
---

The *db/* folder contains the SQL source code for
initializing the underlying database for LoRA.

## Testing

You can run the database tests with the following command:

    $ pg_prove --dbname mox --username mox --schema test

Alternatively, you can run them within the Python test harness:

    (python-env) $ python -m unittest -vbf tests.test_sql

The tests are written in `PL/pgSQL` using the [pgTAP](https://pgtap.org)
framework and located in `tests/`.

## Organisation

The templates are organised as follows:

`basis`

>   Initial definitions, structures, extensions, etc.

`funcs/pre`

>   Initial function definitions.

`templates`

>   The above-mentioned templates specifying core types, tables, functions,
etc. for each

`funcs/post`

>   Function definitions requiring the core tables and types.

`tests`

>   The above-mentions PL/pgSQL tests; not loaded into a production database.

## Templates

We generate many PostgreSQL functions and definitions from Jinja2
templates:

-   `./templates/` contains the
    [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templates.
-   `../oio_rest/tests/fixtures/db-dump.sql` contains an up-to-date
    version of the output.

After updating the templates, run the tests mentioned above. One of the
tests compares the rendered templates to a fixture, and will fail if the
changes affect the resulting SQL. To fix this, replace the old results
with the new ones:

    $ mv ../oio_rest/tests/fixtures/db-dump.sql.new \
    >    ../oio_rest/tests/fixtures/db-dump.sql

Then, inspect the changes using e.g. `git diff`.
