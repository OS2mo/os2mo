### Version 0.9.0, 7 May 2018

This is a major version, including non-backwards-compatible changes to
the REST protocol, parameter checks, JSON input validation, unit tests
and integration tests.

Backwards incompatible changes:

-   Allow replacing an object with PUT - updates now use PATCH
    (non-compatible with previous versions).

    object.

    given unrecognised or unsupported arguments.

    -   Integration tests based on the standards.

    Previously, we either allowed searching within an interval or the
    current time.

    rather than 2.7.
-   New and improved installer based on SaltStack to enable provisioning
    of client installations.

Bug fixes:

-   Fixed semantics for DELETE, so that we no longer merge old entries
    when reviving an object.
