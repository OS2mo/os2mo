MOX Messaging Service and Actual State Database
===============================================

Introduction
============

This project contains an implementation of the OIO object model, used as
a standard for data exchange by the Danish government, for use with a
MOX messaging queue.

You can find the current MOX specification here:

<http://www.kl.dk/ImageVaultFiles/id_55874/cf_202/MOX_specifikation_version_0.PDF>

As an example, you can find the Organisation hierarchy here:

<http://digitaliser.dk/resource/991439>

In each installation of MOX, it is possible to only enable some of the
hierarchies, but we provide the following four OIO hierarchies by
default:

-   *Klassifikation*
-   *Sag*
-   *Dokument*
-   *Organisation*

Documentation
-------------

The official location for the documentation is:

-   <http://mox.readthedocs.io/>

Please note that as a convention, all shell commands have been prefixed
with a dollar-sign, or `$`, representing a prompt. You should exclude
this when entering the command in your terminal.

Audience
--------

This is a technical guide. It is split in two:

User documentation

>   Contains documentation for the REST API and setup documentation. You
    are not expected to have a profound knowledge of the system as such,
    but you do have to know your way in a Bash prompt --- you should be
    able to change the Apache or Nginx configuration and e.g. disable or
    change the SSL certificate on your own.

Developer documentation

>   Contains documentation for developers of the mox codebase and
    building and testing instructions.
