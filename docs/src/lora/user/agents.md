# MOX Agents

!!! warning
    This is outdated. It describes agents which were part of an older
    iteration of the LoRa stack.


Within the context of the Mox Messaging Service, agents are small pieces
of software which either listen on an AMQP queue and perform operations
on the incoming data, or expose certain operations as a web service.

The default installation includes the following agents:

**MoxDocumentDownload**

>   Web service for exporting actual state contents as Excel spreadsheets.

**MoxDocumentUpload**

>   Web service for importing data from Excel spreadsheets into the actual state database.

**MoxRestFrontend**

>   AMQP agent bridging the REST API.

**MoxTabel**

>   AQMP worker agent MoxDocumentDownload & MoxDocumentUpload.

## `python_agents` folder

This directory contains the Notify to AMQP service, which serves as a
working example of a relay of the internal PostgresSQL notifications to
a publicly available notification service.

### Legacy agents

Besides, this directory contains the following 2 (legacy) mox agents:

|Legacy Agents ||                  |
|------------- || ---------------- |
|MOX Advis     || mox_advis.py     |
|MOX Elk Log   || mox_elk_log.py   |

These agents were part of the early iterations of the Lora stack.
However, these agents are not used in the current release (may be added
in the forseeable future).

The two agents are currently unsupported and not part of the default
installation procedure.

### Update/Dependencies

MOX Advis & MOX Elk Log have previouly been coupled with the OIO Rest
package. The agents have now been de-coupled and do not depend on
external settings and python dependencies.

However the agents depend on a local OIO Rest module: saml2.py
(Saml2_Assertion class). This dependency is not Python 3 compatible and
will be removed or refactored when the code is moved to Python 3.

### Installation

A installation strategy (formula) has been created, however as
previously described the agents have unresolved dependencies.

As such they are not automatically installed as part of the stack.

!!! note
    Once the dependencies have been resolved, it should be relatively easy
    to adjust the installation strategy.
