Example of deleting attributes
==============================

To clear / delete a previously set attribute value -- lets say the
egenskab `supplement` of a `Facet`-object -- specify the empty string as
the attribute value in the JSON body:

    …
    "attributter": {
            "facetegenskaber": [
                {
                "supplement": "",
                "virkning": {
                    "from": "2014-05-19",
                    "to": "infinity",
                    "aktoerref": "ddc99abd-c1b0-48c2-aef7-74fea841adae",
                    "aktoertypekode": "Bruger",
                    "notetekst": "Clearing supplement, defined by a mistake."
                }
                }
            ]
        },
    …

To delete all previously set attribute values of a specific kind - for
all `virkning`-periods - you may simply specify an empty list for the
given type of attribute. Eg. to clear all `egenskaber` for a `Facet` -
for all `virkning`-periods, you should do this:

    …
    "attributter": {
            "facetegenskaber": [
               ]
        },
    …

Please notice, that this is different than omitting the list completely,
in which case, the specific attributes will not be updated at all. Eg.
if you omit the `facetegenskaber`-key in the `attributter`-object in the
JSON body supplied to the `UpdateOperation`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, all the `facetegenskaber` of the previous registration will
be carried over untouched. :

    ...
    "attributter": {
        },
    ...

Example of deleting states
==========================

Similar to the procedure stated above for the attributes -
clearing/deleting previously set states is done be supplying the empty
string as value and the desired virknings period. Eg. to clear state
`publiceret` of a `Facet`-object, the relevant part of the JSON body
should look like this:

    ...
     "tilstande": {
            "facetpubliceret": [{
                "publiceret": "",
                "virkning": {
                    "from": "2014-05-19",
                    "to": "infinity",
                    "aktoerref": "ddc99abd-c1b0-48c2-aef7-74fea841adae",
                    "aktoertypekode": "Bruger",
                    "notetekst": "Clearing publiceret, defined by a mistake."
                }
            }
            ]
        },
    ...

You can clear all states of a specific kind, by explicitly specifying a
completely empty list. Eg. to clear `facetpubliceret` for all
`virkning`-periods, the specific part of the JSON body should look like
this: :

    ...
     "tilstande": {
            "facetpubliceret": [
            ]
        },
    ...

Please notice, that this is different than omitting the list completly,
in which case, the specific state will not be updated at all. Eg. if you
omit the `facetpubliceret`-key in the `tilstande`-object in the JSON
body supplied to the `UpdateOperation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
all the `facetpubliceret` state values of the previous registration will
be carried over untouched. :

    ...
     "tilstande": {
        },
    ...

Example of deleting relations
=============================

Again, similar to the procedure stated above for the attributes and
states, clearing a previously set relation with cardinality 0..1 is done
by supplying empty strings for both `uuid` and `urn` of the relation.
Eg. to clear a previously set the `ansvarlig` of a `Facet`-object, the
specific part of the JSON body would look like this:

    ...
    "relationer": {
            "ansvarlig": [
            {
                "uuid": "",
                "urn" : "",
                "virkning": {
                    "from": "2014-05-19",
                    "to": "infinity",
                    "aktoerref": "ddc99abd-c1b0-48c2-aef7-74fea841adae",
                    "aktoertypekode": "Bruger",
                    "notetekst": "Nothing to see here!"

                }
            }
            ]
    }
    ...

When updating relations with unlimited cardinality (0..n), you have to
supply the full list - that is, all the relations of the particular type
- and clearing a particular relation of a given type is accordingly done
by supplying the full list sans the relation, that you wish to clear.
(The exception to this is when updating the `Sag`-object, where you can
specify an `indeks` of the relation to only update a particular
relation). To delete all the relations of a particular type with
unlimited cardinality (0..n) you must use the same procedure as
described above for relations with cardinality 0..1, where you specify a
single relation of the given type with an empty string for `uuid` and
`urn` and with a `virkning`-period as desired.

Specifying an explicitly empty object will clear all the relations of
the object. Eg.:

    ...
      "relationer": {}
    ...

Notice, that this is different than omitting the `relationer`-key
entirely, which will carry over all the relations of the registration
untouched.
