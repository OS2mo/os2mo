title: API tutorial

The following small exercises can be used as an inspiration to getting
to know LoRa\'s REST API. Read or skim the pages about the
`objects`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and the different
`api-operations`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} before moving on.

Warning
:::

The exact end-date for the date ranges are not important, it is however
important that they are in the *future* when you do this tutorial. If
they are not the `ReadOperation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`ListOperation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`SearchOperation`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} will not return the
object unless the `virkning*`-parameters is set.

1.  Create an `organisation` called e.g. "Magenta" valid from 2017-01-01
    (included) to 2025-12-31 (excluded).
2.  Make a query searching for all `organisation` in LoRa - confirm that
    Magenta exists in the system.
3.  Create an `organisationenhed` called "Magenta" (which should be a
    subunit to the `organisation` Magenta) active from 2017-01-01
    (included) to 2024-03-14 (excluded). Consider which attributes and
    relations to set.
4.  Create an `organisationenhed` called "Copenhagen" (which should be a
    subunit to the `organisationenhed` Magenta) active from 2017-01-01
    (included) to 2024-03-14 (excluded). Consider which attributes and
    relations to set.
5.  Create an `organisationenhed` called "Aarhus" (which should be a
    subunit of the `organisationenhed` Magenta) active from 2018-01-01
    (included) to 2025-09-01 (excluded). Consider which attributes and
    relations to set.
6.  Make a query searching for all `organisationenhed` in LoRa - confirm
    that Magenta, Copenhagen and Aarhus exist in the system.
7.  Add an `address` to the `organisationenhed` Aarhus (valid within the
    period where the `organisationenhed` is active).
8.  Fetch the `organisationenhed` Aarhus and verify that the newly added
    `address` is present in the response.
9.  Add another `address` to the `organisationenhed` Aarhus (valid in a
    period exceeding the period where the `organisationenhed` is
    active). What happens in this case?
10. Remove all `address` from the `organisationenhed` Aarhus and confirm
    that they are gone afterwards.
11. Make a small script capable of adding `n` new `organisationenhed`
    (e.g. where 10 \< `n` \< 20) named orgEnhed1, orgEnhed2,
    orgEnhed3,\... These `organisationenhed` should all be subunits of
    the `organisationenhed` Copenhagen and they should be active in
    random intervals ranging from 2017-01-01 (included) to 2025-12-31
    (excluded).
12. Find all active `organisation` (if any) in the period from
    2017-12-01 to 2025-06-01.
13. What are the names of the `organisationenhed` from above?
