# File operations

## File upload

When performing an [Import operation](../import.md), [Create operation](../create.md) 
or [Update operation](../update.md) on a `Dokument`, it is possible (if desired) to 
simultaneously upload files. These requests should be made using 
`multipart/form-data`-encoding. The encoding is the same that is used for HTML upload 
forms.

The JSON input for the request should be specified in a `form`-field
called `json`. Any uploaded files should be included in the
multpart/form-data request as separate `form`-fields.

The `indhold`-attribute of any `DokumentDel` may be a URI pointing to
one of these uploaded file "fields". In that case, the URI must be of
the format:

```
field:myfield
```

where myfield is the `form`-field name of the uploaded file included in
the request that should be referenced by the `DokumentDel`.

It is also possible to specify any URI (e.g. `http://....`, etc.) as the
value of the `indhold`-attribute. In that case, the URI will be stored,
however no file will be downloaded and stored to the server. It is then
expected that the consumer of the API knows how to access the URI.

## File download 

When performing a [Read operation](../read.md) or [List operation](../list.md) on a 
`Dokument`, the `DokumentDel`-subobjects returned will include an `indhold` attribute.
This attribute has a value that is the "content URI" of that file on
the OIO REST API server. An example:

```
"indhold": "store:2015/08/14/11/53/4096a8df-ace7-477e-bda1-d5fdd7428a95.bin"
```

To download the file referenced by this URI, you must construct a
request similar to the following:

```
http://localhost:5000/dokument/dokument/2015/08/14/11/53/4096a8df-ace7-477e-bda1-d5fdd7428a95.bin
```
