title: Operating LoRa MOX
---

It is the intention that mox is run by gunicorn behind a reverse proxy
such as nginx.

As the primary bottleneck is the connection between mox and its'
database, you can make the application accept connections faster by
scaling the number gunicorn workers. Use more workers and use the sync
worker class.
