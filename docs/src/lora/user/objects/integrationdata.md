title: Integrationdata
---

`integrationsdata` is a regular text field intended for information from
extern systems so they can be kept in sync. This field should only
include values that do not belong in another field. Do not overuse it.
It is not part of the OIO standard.

Usage
=====

The intention is that `integrationsdata` always contains a JSON-valid
piece of text. Applications that use the field should parse it as JSON
and send valid JSON in return.

Warning
:::

When you want to add or update a field in `integrationsdata`, please
make sure to send all the existing fields along, so they are not
accidentally removed. This is easy to mess up, so take care.

``` {.json}

  "attributter": {
    "organisationegenskaber": [{
      "brugervendtnoegle": "magenta-aps",
      "organisationsnavn": "Magenta ApS",
      "virkning": {

      "integrationsdata": "{\"sdløn\": \"id5402349\", \"IB\": 4}"
    }]
  },
  "tilstande": {
    "organisationgyldighed": [{

      "virkning": {
        "from": "2017-01-01",
        "to": "2019-03-14"
      }
    }
  ]}
}
```

Notice that the quotes (`"`) in `integrationsdata` have been escaped as
`\"`.
