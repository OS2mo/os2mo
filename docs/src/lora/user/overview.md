On a high level the MOX actual state database consists of three server
processes and several agents joining them together.

Server processes
================

PostgreSQL

:   Database server providing the storage of the bi-temporal actual
    state database as well as validation and verification of the basic
    constraints.

Gunicorn

:   WSGI server for the oio rest api. Ideally used with a frontend HTTP
    proxy in production.

RabbitMQ

:   AMQP message broker providing interprocess communication between the
    various components.
