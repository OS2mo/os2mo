# Deployment

## System requirements

LoRA currently supports Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial). We recommend running it
on a VM with the following allocation:

|                        | CPU        | Memory | Storage | Disk type           |
| :--------------------: | ---------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------- |
| **Minimal**            | 1 core     | 2 GB   | 15 GB   | any(*SSD* or *HDD*) |
| **Test & development** | 2 cores    | 4 GB   | 30 GB   | SSD *(recommended)* |
| **Production**         | 4 cores    | 4 GB   | 60 GB   | SSD                 |

You should initially provision all the storage space you expect to use,
as adjusting it is somewhat cumbersome. By comparison, increasing or
decreasing CPU and memory is trivial.

## Getting started

!!! warning
    FIXME Fillout this section.

In a production environment, it is recommended to bind the oio_rest
service to a unix socket, then expose the socket using a HTTP proxy of
your own choosing.

(Recommended: Nginx or Apache)
