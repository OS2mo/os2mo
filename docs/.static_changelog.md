## 11.11.0 (2022-09-27)

- [#52316] Cleanup Employee Create

This commit changes how the RequestHandler dict is generated.
It is now generated via `to_handler_dict` similar to how
`create_org_unit` does it.

All the relevant tests have been rewritten to follow the style that
`create_org_unit` utilizes.

Finally the input model has been modified, with the following changes:

- Take a separate `givenname` (first name) and `surname` (last name)

Previously the code took just a 'name' and the backend had to split it
up. We prefer to get structured data directly from the source over
trying to derive it on demand.

- Ensures names are actually set

Previously the code would accept the empty string for the `name`
parameter, however the validation logic actually acquires a non-empty
string.

A change has been made to ensure that the strings are actually set.

- The CPR number field has been renamed from `cpr_no` to `cpr_number`

Bytes are cheap and we might as well use a fuller name.

- The CPR number field has been made optional

We deploy OS2mo in non-danish contexts, thus we cannot assume a CPR
number is always available. We could consider converting it to a more
generic 'national identification number' concept.

- User-key has been added

A lot of integrations utilize the user-key for a domain specific key,
for instance the employee identifier in the HR system.

Note: This is really a breaking change as `name` has been removed, and
as `cpr_no` has been renamed, thus breaking the current interface.
Usually we would handle such a change by creating a new GraphQL
version, however as noone uses the current interface yet, we are
okay with breaking it without creating a new version.

## 11.10.0 (2022-09-27)

## 11.7.1 (2022-09-21)

execution exits.

## 11.7.0 (2022-09-20)

- [#50861] Make GraphQL org unit parent return an optional single object.

The old behaviour -- returning an optional _list_, which always contained
exactly one element -- has been deprecated, but will continue to work in the v1
GraphQL API until 2023-03-01. Consumers should upgrade to /graphql/v2 as soon as
possible.

## 11.6.0 (2022-09-20)

- [#52316] Require admin for all GraphQL mutators

  overwritten for all salt deployment in
  [MR2494](https://git.magenta.dk/labs/salt-automation/-/merge_requests/2494).

## 10.5.2 (2022-09-08)

Install poetry in a isolated environment

This fixes build problems where poetry changes the dependencies for poetry
itself when installing packages.

This also cleans up the `Dockerfile` for various rot.

## 10.5.1 (2022-09-07)

- [#51898] Fixed DetailsTerminate in mora.service, so its validity argument is of type OpenValidity, which allows to_date to be none.

## 10.5.0 (2022-09-07)

- [#50647] Add versioning to the GraphQL API

Clients should always refer and pin themselves to a specific version of the
GraphQL API, which is available on /graphql/vX. Navigating to /graphql in a
browser will redirect to GraphiQL for the latest version.
POSTing to the legacy /graphql endpoint is still supported for compatibility,
but support will be dropped in the near future.

We have discovered that metrics are being updated on EVERY REQUEST against MO!
Not just on requests against the /metrics endpoint, as we had imagined.

This means that every single request against MO results in 5 requests to other systems.
Among these is a request to DAR, which means that MOs minimum request response-time is the round-trip time to DAR.

This change temporarily disables these 5 metrics, with a plan to reintroduce them later.

- [#23558] The employee is now optional on managers.

### API Changes

- [#24200] Move all writing and editing APIs from `/service/ou` and
  `/service/e/` to a shared endpoint `/service/details`. This
  primarily means that writing operations no longer require knowledge of the
  user, allowing e.g. vacant managers.

### Bug Fixes

- [#24067] Fixed being able to edit root organisational units
- [#23559] Display end dates _inclusively_, so that the year ends 31
  December rather than 1 January.

### Known bugs

- [#24134] Sorting doesn't work after performing an update.
