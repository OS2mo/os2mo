    The latest version is never explicitly versioned or exposed directly. Clients should
    always refer and pin themselves to a specific version, which is available as the
    latest `vN` version package, inheriting from this class without modifications.
    When a new breaking change must be introduced to the GraphQL schema, the change is
    made in `latest` and the `vN` package is changed to be an adapter which maintains
    backwards-compatibility. A new `vN+1` package is created to expose latest.

    As an example, see the merge request for the first breaking change:
    https://git.magenta.dk/rammearkitektur/os2mo/-/merge_requests/1184
